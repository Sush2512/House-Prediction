# House-Prediction
Machine Learning- Classification

## Summary
This project involved predicting whether a house is "Expensive" or "Not expensive" using historical data on housing prices in Ames, Iowa. As part of a Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School, I implemented classification models to analyze real estate pricing, focusing on supervised machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn (classification algorithms, cross-validation), Pandas, LazyPredict

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced proficiency in classification techniques within supervised machine learning, particularly in model selection, feature engineering, and data splitting.
- Practiced data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing with pipelines to improve model performance.
- Gained insights into cross-validation and error analysis to fine-tune models and identify optimal algorithms.

## Challenges Overcame
- Managed a dataset with over 1,500 entries and 80 features, requiring significant cleaning and preparation to ensure model accuracy.
- Experimented with multiple classification algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to find the model with the highest accuracy.
- Iteratively refined the models and evaluated accuracy to prepare a final submission for a Streamlit competition within the bootcamp.

## Additional Reflections
This project illustrated the value of trying different models and utilizing tools like LazyPredict for a quick assessment of model performance. Combining machine learning with domain knowledge in real estate opened up new perspectives on data-driven decision-making. Exploring other techniques like hyperparameter tuning would likely yield further performance improvements in future work.
